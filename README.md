# PlaneRequestBot

The name of the program is Bot.py
If python 3 is not already installed on your computer, you must do so from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, from the same user where the python installation is, open a command line and type in "pip install scipy"

Then, after scipy has finished downloading, in the same command line, type "pip install numpy". This ensures that python has loaded the proper modules for the search algorithm

Clone the repository with the "Clone" button on github, and select a folder to place the repository in on your system. Extract the files to a separate folder. To run Bot.py, open 
a command line and use "cd" and "cd.." to navigate to the folder that has Bot.py and the other text files in it. Once you have navigated to the correct folder, type "py Bot.py" and 
press Enter. You should see a series of responses from twitch and then you will start receiving messages, in the case that AdamTheEnginerd is online.
