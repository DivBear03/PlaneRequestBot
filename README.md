# PlaneRequestBot

The name of the program is Bot.py
If python 3 is not already installed on your computer, you must do so from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

From the same user where the python installation is, open a command line and type in "pip install scipy"
Also use pip to install numpy with "pip install numpy"
Also use pip to install requests with "pip install requests"

Clone the repository with the "Clone" button on github, and select a folder to place the repository in on your system. Extract the files to a separate folder. To run Bot.py, open a command line and use "cd" and "cd.." to navigate to the folder that has Bot.py and the other text files in it. Once you have navigated to the correct folder, type "py Bot.py" and press Enter. Type in the channel name, with or without the hash mark, and click Enter. Then, type in the maximum number of planes that you want in the request list at any given time and click Enter. The program will then connect to twitch and start displaying chat messages and occasionally printing the uptime and viewer count every 10 seconds.
